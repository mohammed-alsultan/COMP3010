## SOC Monitoring Overview

SOC monitoring relies on continuous visibility across systems, networks,
and cloud platforms. In this exercise, Splunk functions as the central
log aggregation and analysis platform.

AWS CloudTrail and S3 access logs provide insight into identity usage,
configuration changes, and object-level activity, while endpoint logs
support system-level monitoring.
