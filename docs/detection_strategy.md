## Detection Strategy

Detection logic in this investigation prioritises cloud misconfigurations
and authentication assurance.

Key detection objectives include:
- Identifying S3 buckets exposed to public access
- Detecting AWS API calls without MFA
- Highlighting unusual endpoint configurations
